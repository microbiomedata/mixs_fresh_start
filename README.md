# mixs_fresh_start

This project provides support for converting the MIxS standard into LinkML via schemasheets

The current implemntation focuses on aiding curators in distilling global definitions for terms that have (intentional or not) variations in the contest of different environmentla packages.

This prject can save a colored log of the difference between the original combined sheet and any user-provided differences in the modified sheet. **It only works on Linux systems at this point.**

This project requires the following system dependencies in addition to the Python libraties in pyproject.toml
- https://github.com/aswinkarthik/csvdiff for streaming the colored diff to STDOUT
  - this can be run on MacOS too, sending the colored output to the screen
- The linux version of https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/script.1.html for saving the colored diff to a "typescript" file
- https://github.com/theZiz/aha for converting the colored "typescript" file to HTML
- optionally soemthing like https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/blob/master/docs/usage/wkhtmltopdf.txt to convert the HTML output to PDF

The HTML report that is bundled with this repo can be viewed with this [htmlpreview.github.io link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/microbiomedata/mixs_fresh_start/blob/main/assets/mixs_combined_diff_conservative.html)

_Note that this report skips a few MIxS terms that cause the difference engine to crash. See project.Makefile._
